    challenge: `The main challenge on this project was to make the Sockets work, because there is a lot of data to care about, for example when you are watching a specific review and someone deletes that review and that route do not exist more. Another tricky thing was the Spotify Player with the SDK, because it is actually a library, and style it was difficult, but with help of hard CSS I could done it.`,

    challenge: `I faced a lot of issues, because back then, my knowledge was very poor, the first one was that each image must have to be saved in their original resolution, and an average mobile picture may be very heavy, and I tought that it was a good idea to save the binary files directlly on my database ðŸ™ƒ, then I realize my error and change that to save my images in my server and the directory on my database. I recently had to transfer all the files from one server to another completely new, because the first one was very slow, at the moment we have register more than 4000 of registers and images. The second problem was the compatibility through all the devices, android, iphone and also in the different browsers as Chrome and Safari. And the last one was that the Media Devices API is kind of new, and there are a lot of different screen sizes and camera resolutions that I had to support and adapt.`,

    challenge: `The hardest part of this project, was to work along the Riot API, it is a disaster, it is very confusing the properties of the objects, they changes between each endpoint, for example, when you fetch the matches, the "id" of a champion is in the propertie "champion", and when you fetch all the champion the "id" of a champion is the name of the champion, and the id is named "key" ðŸ˜•. The API uses for the positions the common keywords as mid, bottom, jungle, etc, but when you want to fetch the images, you have to use words like "middle", "utility", "bottom", and its make the work harder. And these type of situations are all around the API! I also learned a lot more about error handle.`,
